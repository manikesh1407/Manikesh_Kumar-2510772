🚦 Toll Booth Vehicle Count System
📌 Project Overview

The Toll Booth Vehicle Count System is a simple console-based application developed in C programming.
This project is designed to simulate a real-world toll booth vehicle counting system, where different types of vehicles passing through a toll gate are counted and displayed using 1D arrays.


🎯 Why This Project Was Created (Project Purpose)

## 🚘 Vehicle Type Mapping
Vehicle Type	Input Code	Array Index
| Vehicle Type | Input Code | Array Index |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Car          | 1          | 0           |
| Bike         | 2          | 1           |
| Truck        | 3          | 2           |
| Bus          | 4          | 3           |
